 * This is the primary entry point for the trip planning web service.

 * RoutingResource superclass, which also has methods for building routing requests from query
 * parameters. This allows multiple web services to have the same set of query parameters.
 * In order for inheritance to work, the REST resources are request-scoped (constructed at each request)
 * rather than singleton-scoped (a single instance existing for the lifetime of the OTP server).
